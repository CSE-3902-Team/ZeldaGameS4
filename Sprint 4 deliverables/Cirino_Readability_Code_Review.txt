Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
	- The HandleCollision() method is very easy to read. The if statements are extremely intuitive, almost as if it were written in plain English.

	- The UnlockDoor() method is difficult to read because of the large number of methods being called in a row. In particular, I had a very hard time understanding line 86 because of how many method calls there are.

	- Lastly, the MovePlayerAwatFromDoor() method was also very easy to read because of its simplicity and its similarity to other collision Handler methods.
	
Proposed change: I would just focus on cleaning up the UnlockDoor() method by breaking things up into variables/fields in order to make it easier to understand. Also in the HandleCollision() method, add that if a door is locked and keyCount <= 0, move the player away from the door. It should not be difficult to make this change with the current implementation.
