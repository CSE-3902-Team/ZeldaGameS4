Sprint number: 4

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: DragonFireBall

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Zening 

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 8 minutes

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	-Lines 69-74: Instead of hard coding the direction the firball moves you could have a direction in the constructor that defines where it will go. This would remove the need
	for the other two classes for fireballs and make the code more maintainable.

	-Lines 53-54: the destinationX and destinationY variables should be a vector and you can just assign it with the destination in the constructor

Proposed change: The update collision box should use the source rectagle for the values for it rather than hardcoded sizes. this would make the code more resistant to scale changes.
