Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	-Line 47-53: So this is the condition that indicates a room transition is in progress, looks like some
	bookkeeping is being done but it's hard to know what purpose it serves. I think these lines should be
	in a well named helper function to give it some meaning.

	-line 60 and line 64: I think changee state method should use enums to indicate which room it's changing to.
