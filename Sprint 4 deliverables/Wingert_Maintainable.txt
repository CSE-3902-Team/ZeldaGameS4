Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	-Lines 16-17: I think it's bad to calculate center from the hardcoded resolution values. It's best to 
	use backbuffer.width and backbuffer.height just in case we change resolution in the future

	-Lines 85-94: You should can just initalize these variables at the class level they don't ever change, no reason to init them
	every draw.

Proposed change: move rectangle initalazations to the class level or the constructor. This requires little 
effort and will slightly increase performance.
