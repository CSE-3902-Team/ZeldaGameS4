Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	-Line 83-133: There is a lot of whitespace between lines for no reason. The rightSpot variable name is vauge. I am not sure what this is supposed to be doing. 
	Naming your if statemant cases to show what it is checking for (ie link above, to the side) would make it easier to debug and read.

	-line 85-86: creating a new object for moving the enemy seems unnecisary. This would be good to have in a method, but I do not see what makes it need a new class.
